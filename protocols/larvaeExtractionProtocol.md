# Extraction Protocol

## Description
Protocol for extracting oyster larvae and zygote samples that have been stored on filter paper. Protocol is based on a [Sawada et al 2008 protocol](https://search.proquest.com/docview/224123298?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true), which has been modified by the [Hare lab group](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/protocols/hare_larvaeExtractionProtocol.md).  

## Reagents

|Reagent|Amount (per sample)|
|:-----:|:----:|
| Digestion Buffer | 800 uL |
| Proteinase K (13.5XX) | 20 uL |
| EtOH (100%) | 2 mL |
| 3M Sodium Acetate | 100 uL |
| Fresh EtOH (70%) | 2 mL |
| TRIS-HCL (pH 8.0) | 60 uL |

**Other Items**
* 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes (x3)
* 10,200,1000 uL pipet tips
* Scapel
* Fine tip tweezers

## Steps

### 1) **Larval/Zygote filter paper removal**  

    a) Setup space (picture below).
    b) Add 800 uL of digestion buffer and 180 uL molecular grade water to each centrifuge tube (one for each sample).
    c) Gently remove filter from whirlpack. Larvae are on the filter, so handle it with care as you remove it from the whirlpack.
    d) Make sure the filter is sample side up and rinse with 70% EtOH (I use a squeeze bottle for this). Rinsing the filter over the beaker. Make sure you rinse off any salt, then rinse the edge of the filter to push the larvae towards the center of the filter (not all larvae will move).  
    e) Let the filter air dry for 1-3 minutes. The filter paper should NOT have any standing EtOH, but should look slightly (wet). I do no wait for the paper to completely dry.  
    f) Use a sterile scapel to remove the filter paper from the plastic frame. I usually do this be holding the scapel in place and rotating the filter to cut the paper. I then use the tweezers to transfer the filter paper to the centrifuge tubes.
    g) Add 20 uL Prot K.
    h) Invert tubes several times and ensure the filter paper is completely submerged in the digestion solution and then digest over night (40C, 1000 rpm).

### 2) **Lysis and Digestion**  
This protocol was modified from Sawada et al 2008.  

    a) Combine 800 uL digestion buffer and 180 uL molecular grade H20 in 1.5 mL tube. 
    b) Gently fold filter paper with sample into 1.5 mL tube.
    c) Add 20 uL Proteinase K.
    d) Invert tube several times then use tweezers as needed to make sure filter is completely submerged below disgestion buffer.
    e) Incubate at 55C overnight or until all soft material has digested.

**Notes**: Shells may remain. Shells will often also stay partially closed for extended periods of time, so overnight digestion is often necessary.  

### 3) **Purification**  

Ethanol precipitation.  

    a) Set 100% EtoH into -20 C freezer (you will need 2mL x number of sampeles) for at least 30 minutes. And get your centrifuge to temp (-11C).
    b) Use pipet to mix lysate then transfer 500uL into a new 1.5 mL tube. Leave the filter in the first tube initially.
    c) To each tube add 1000 uL 100% EtOH (2x volume of cold (-20C) 100% ethanol). 
    b) Add 50 uL 3M sodium acetate (1/10 volume of lysate). 
    c) Mix by quickly inverting several times.
    d) Incubate at -20 for at least 20 minutes.
    e) Centrifuge 10 minutes at maximum speed (at least 12k rpm). A refrigerated centrifuge is ideal, but room temperature can also be used.
    f) Remove the supernatant. A pellet may not be visible, so care must be taken with this step.
    g) Add 500ul 70% ethanol to wash the pellet. Invert several times, then centrifuge 5 minutes at maximum speed. Remove supernatant.
    h) Repeat g once more for a total of two washes.
    i) Air dry the pellet until all liquid has just disappeared, usually 5-10 minutes.
    j) Resuspend in an appropriate volume of water or (ideally) of Tris HCl pH 7.5-8.

### 4) **Results**
  
**Quantification**  
* Used Qubit HS to quantify samples. This approach generally leads to small quantities, which can only be quantified on HS kits.  
* Also worth running on a gel to ensure the product is high quality (large fragment size). I use a 1.5 or 2% agarose gel.  
* I have also used a standard bead clean-up if the extraction products had lots of small fragments.
