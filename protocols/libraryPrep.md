# Custom bisulfite conversion and library prep protocol

## Overview
This protocol uses the (Pico Methyl-seq library prep Kit by Zymo)[https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/pico-methyl-seq-library-prep-kit] and mostly follows the manufacturers instructions outline in the [instruction manual](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/protocols/_d5455_d5456_picomethylseq.pdf), but deviates at step 4 and 5 following the recommendations of the Putnam lab ([notebook entry here](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/notebook/20200827_PutnamProtocolForPicoMethylationKit.md)).
