# Plan for library prep and sequencing

After conversation with Katie we decided to proceed with a unique dual index approach for all samples. This means using unique barcodes for both the i5 and i7, such that no two samples share EITHER the i5 or i7 barcode. To do this I am ordering unique i5 and i7 primers for each of the 37 samples (74 total oligos). The plan will be to prep the samples in small batches (2 to start then 6 a day is the smaller number was successful). It is expected to take 7-10 days without any hiccups.
