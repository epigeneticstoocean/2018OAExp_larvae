# Summary of Larvae and Zygote Extractions

## Description
 Using a modified version of the Sawada / Hare et al protocol I extracted all filtered larvae and zygote samples from block 1. This included zygote samples and larvae samples. Samples were stored in approximately 60ul of TRIS HCL buffered solution and placed in the -80 for long term storage.

### General Notes

* Initial extractions had higher concentrations, especially the zygote extractions, but this seemed to be due to an abundance of low quality fragments. A bead clean up was used to remove small fragments.
* Less DNA was extracted overall from larvae samples, however, these tended to be higher quality samples. 
* Five larvae samples failed completely and another five had < 1 ng/uL. Even these samples should be enough for the pico methylation kit.
