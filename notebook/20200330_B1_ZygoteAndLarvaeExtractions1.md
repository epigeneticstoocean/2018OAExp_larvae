 ### Protocol
  
  Extraction steps follow the the [Hare et al. protocol](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/protocols/hare_larvaeExtractionProtocol.md). Differences outlines below

**Overnight Digestion** 

  * A 1000 ul digestion solution (800ul buffer, 180 ul H20, 20 ul Prot K) was prepped in a 1.5mL centrifuge tube for each sample.
  * Filters were removed from the -80 freezer 2 at a time. Using a small amount of 70% EtoH (in a squeeze bottle) the filters were gently rinsed, trying to move and visible material towards the middle of the filter. The EtoH was given 1-2 min to completely pass through the mesh or evaporate.
  * Using a sterile scapel the mesh was cut from the filters, and using tweezers was carefully transferred to the 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.
  
**Extraction**
  
  * Split the digestion solution into two 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes (500ul each) and proceeded with the extraction protocol as described in the link, increasing the volumes as needed.
  * After the initial 12 min centrifuge step, filters were gently removed from the centrifuge tubes taking care not to disturb the precipitate at the bottom. I then centrifuged these samples for an additional 4 minutes.
  
**Final Elutions**

  * I used 30uL of TRIS HCl to elute the DNA for each tube (60uL of solution for each sample)
  * I transferred the elution solution from replicate tubes into a final centrifuge tube for final use and storage. I also kept the original tubes which tended to contain additional material at the bottom which I believe is mostly salt. However, in the event that this also contains some DNA from the samples I kept those vial in the -80.

### Synopsis

* Looks like we have a viable amount of DNA from all the samples, even the larvae, for the type of library kit we are using.
* The larvae dna in particular looked like good quality. However, many of the zygote samples appear to be of somewhat degraded quality (no clear large fragment band on the gels). My next step will be to explore whether trying to resuspend / elute the residual salt precipitate from the extraction will yield additional high quality DNA.
