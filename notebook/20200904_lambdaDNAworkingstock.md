# Created lambda working stock

### Overview
Created a dilution of [umethylated lambda DNA](https://www.promega.com/products/biochemicals-and-labware/nucleic-acids/unmethylated-lambda-dna/?catNum=D1521#specifications)  to be included in BS conversion to evaluate conversion efficiency. The sample will be diluted to **5 ng/ul**. 


Lambda DNA will be used to measure BS conversion efficiency following this [protocol](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/notebook/20200827_PutnamProtocolForPicoMethylationKit.md).

The goal for each sample is to use **100ng** of input DNA and **5ng** of input lambda DNA (5% of sample). To minimize the input volume (without being too small) I will dilute lambda to **5ng/ul**, which will mean an input volume of **1ul** for the BS conversion.

Starting concentration of umethylated lambda DNA:

$$654 ug /over 1 mL$$
