# Created lambda working stock

### Overview
Created a dilution of [umethylated lambda DNA](https://www.promega.com/products/biochemicals-and-labware/nucleic-acids/unmethylated-lambda-dna/?catNum=D1521#specifications)  to be included in BS conversion to evaluate conversion efficiency. The sample will be diluted to **5 ng/ul**. 


Lambda DNA will be used to measure BS conversion efficiency following this [protocol](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/notebook/20200827_PutnamProtocolForPicoMethylationKit.md).

The goal for each sample is to use **100ng** of input DNA and **5ng** of input lambda DNA (5% of sample). To minimize the input volume (without being too small) I will dilute lambda to **5ng/ul**, which will mean an input volume of **1ul** for the BS conversion.

Starting concentration of umethylated lambda DNA:
654 ug / 1 mL * 1 mL / 1000 uL * 1000 ng / 1 ug = **654 ng / uL**  

Dilute **2 uL of stock lambda DNA** to diluted conc. of **5ng/ul** - 

(654 ng/ul * 2uL) / (5ng/ul) = 261.5 uL (final volume)

261.5 uL - 2 uL = **259.uL of water**
