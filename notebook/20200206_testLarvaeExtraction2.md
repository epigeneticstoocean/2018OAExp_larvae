## Extraction Test

I performed a preliminary test using the protocol provided by Hare Lab ([link to protocol](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/protocols/hare_larvaeExtractionProtocol.md)) using **adult mantle** tissue from the L16 experiment (081 RNA Mantle 080116) and **larvae** from the failed 1-L larval cross experiment (J509).

**PAGE 6 and 7 of lab manual**

## Extraction Protocol

* Followed standard protocol instructions (details in notebook)  
* Used 1000uL lysing buffer/prot k for my blank and larvae sampels (not the mantle samples) so I ended up spliting the volumes after an overnight digestion in and A and B tube. I needed to do this to accomodate the two volumes of EtOH for the initial wash.

## Results

1) Had precipitate left over similar to the zygote test. This doesn't seem to affect the detection of extracted DNA. In addition, I performed the extraction using a blank sample (just water) to confirm that detection of DNA using the qubit wasn't an artifact of this residual precipitate.

### Quantification
 
 Ran sample on Qubit HS DNA
 
  * Larvae J509 A (with filter) : 7.08nl/ul 
  * Larvae J509 B (no filter) : 7.77ng/ul 
  * Mantle Tissue 1 : 75.8 ng/ul
  * Mantle Tissue 2 : TO LOW (this sample failed for some reason?)
  * Blank A : TO LOW   
  * Blank B : TO LOW
 
 Larvae extraction total mass
  * (7.77+7.08)/2 = 7.45 ng/ul * (50ul*2) = **745 ng total larvae DNA**
