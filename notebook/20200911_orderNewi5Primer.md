# Order details for new shorter i5 primers 

### Overview

Based on the last two failed BS conversion tests, I will be ordering a couple of primers that mirror the primers suggested by Zymo [see previous conversation]() rather than the longer i5 primers we currently have (even though these should still technically work but might need optimization).

**Primer template** 
```
5’-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC----------TCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTT-3’ # i5 available in kit
5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACNNNNNNACACTCTTTCCCTACACGAC-3'       # Suggested by rep for ordering

Dashes (-) inserted to align sequence but are not present in actual primers.

``` 
Pasted from Zymo email

For reference the i7 primers that **already come with the Zymo kit**:

| Index | Index Illumina | Index Sequence |
|:-----:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| A | 2 | CGATGT |
| B | 4 | TGACCA |
| C | 5 | ACAGTG |
| D | 6 | GCCAAT |
| E | 7 | CAGATC |
| F | 12 | CTTGTA |

And the list of suggest i5 barcodes from illumina TruSeq HT kit:
| i5 Index Name | i5 Bases |
|:-------------:|:--------:|
| A501 | TGAACCTT |
| A502 | TGCTAAGT |
| A503 | TGTTCTCT |
| A504 | TAAGACAC |
| A505 | CTAATCGA |
| A506 | CTAGAACA |
| A507 | TAAGTTCC |
| A508 | TAGACCTA |

These are currently 8 bases, but the Zymo rep said we could used the first 6 for a shorter primer.
