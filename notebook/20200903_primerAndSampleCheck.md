# Checking different i5 primers and sample concentrations with Qubit

## Overall

Quantified L1 lotterhos primer and LibraryAmp Primer as well as the two samples (EF05xEM01 and CF01xCM01) to check whether the primers and samples appeared to be good quality. This was in response to the earlier primer test which found that using the i5 Lotterhos primer did not lead to amplfication.


### Qubit Results 

| Sample | Conc. (ng/ul) |
|:------:|:-------------:|
| L1 i5 Lotterhos primer  (10 uM) ++ | 29.6 | 
| LibraryAmp Primer (10 uM) | 26.2 |
| L1 if Lotterhos primer original stock (20 uM) +++ | 66.0 |
| EF05xEM01 | 42.8 |
| CM01xCM01 | 48.2 |

++ dilution for pico methylation protocol  
+++ original stock

## Discussion

**Primers** - L1 i5 Lotterhos primers appear to be OK (evidence by the fact that dsDNA was detected at all) and in similar conc. as the libraryAmp Primer provided by Zymo in the kit. It is possible that there is another issue with the primer, but the current stock and dilution appear to be annealed and in comparable concentrations.

**DNA** - The quantity of DNA appears to be sufficient and similar to what was originally detected (EF05xEM01 =  48.4; CF01xCM01 = 47.6). So at least via measurement of quantity the samples still seem to be OK. Also going back to the gell images, both samples had high quality (large fragment DNA). If anything the larvae sample looked better on the gel than the zygote sampels (which is the one that failed the conversion process).
