# Genewiz Submission Criteria for pooled sample


## Requirements

**Recommended Amount**: >1.5 µg @ >20 ng/µL

**Minimum Amount**: 500 ng

**Purity (A260/280)**: 1.8-2.0

**Buffer**: Water, EB, or low TE (<0.1 mM EDTA)

**Note**: We recommend using a dsDNA quantification assay such as Qubit or PicoGreen.

**Shipment Method**: Dry ice

## Thoughts

**Back of the envelope calculation for amount of sample needed for minimum pool size**

~30 viable samples after library prep

500ng / 30 = 16ng (minimum amount of DNA needed per sample)

**If 10 ul of sample**

16/10 = 1.6 ng/ul (minimum concentration)

## Table for variable pool sizes

| Target Amount (ng) | Number of Samples | Amount per sample (ng) | Concentration (ng/ul; given 10uL) | Total Volume of pool (ul) | Estimated Concentration |
|:------------------:|:-----------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 500 | 31 | 16.2 | 1.67 | 37.6 | 13.298 |
| 1000 | 31 | 32.3 | 3.34 | 74.99 | 12.335 |
| 1500 | 31 | 48.4 | 5 | 112.34 | 13.352 |

**NOTES**
1) Amount per sample rounded to the nearest 0.1 ng rounded up.
2) Total pool volume based on round pipet volume of each samples to nearest 0.01 due to limitations on pipetting accuracy.
3) Numbers above were calculated on [the larvae spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l4f2s0nbyNUgenjXhhB8-FzqPRpRpzZvG_iymL_z-WM/edit#gid=351839693)

## Thoughts

In order to achieve the 20 ng/ul concentration recommendation we will have to either to a bead clean up or use the vacuum evaporator.
