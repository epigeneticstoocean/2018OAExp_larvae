# Retested our i5 primer using custom primers

**Overview**: Performed another BS conversion + library prep using 100ng of unmethylated lambda DNA. Used 2 samples (10 uM 1uL L1 primer and 10 uM 1uL Zymo i5 primer) to re-evaluate whether the lack of amplification in the previous test was due to some of the small differences.
