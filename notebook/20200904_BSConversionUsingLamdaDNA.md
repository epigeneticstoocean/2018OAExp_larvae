# Retested our i5 primer using custom primers

**Overview**: Performed another BS conversion + library prep using 100ng of unmethylated lambda DNA. Used 2 samples (10 uM 1uL L1 primer and 10 uM 1uL Zymo i5 primer) to re-evaluate whether the lack of amplification in the previous test was due to some of the small differences.


### BS Conversion and Library Prep

Followed standard manufacturers instruction, but replaced the zymo i5 primer with our custom i5 primer.

**Notes**  
* [dsDNA umethylated lambda DNA diluted](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/notebook/20200904_lambdaDNAworkingstock.md) used for both samples.
* Diluted our i5 primer working stock from 20 uM to 10uM to match zymo i5 conc.
* USed the sam i7 primer (8) for both samples.

### Quant

Used Qubit HS kit

| Sample | Conc. (ng/uL) | 
|:------:|:-------------:|
| Sample 1 (Zymo i5) | 16.4 |
| Sample 2 (custom L1) | 0.848 |

### Discussion

Amplification using the custom i5 primer failed again. This time all aspects of the library prep were identical among samples except the particular i5 primer used. Discussion from the Zymo rep confirmed that the design of our primers should be compatible with their kit, but might require optimization of the annealing temperature.
