## 2018 Larvae Cross Tentative Plan for DNA methylation sequencing

**Purpose**: Identify some short term objectives for determining the number of samples we will sequence to examine the broad question of DNA Methylation inheritance in oysters.

**Goal / Timeline**: Have these results ready for Nov. 12th 2019 to decided target samples

**Information that needs to be confirmed**:

* Number of samples we have available from Block 1
  * 16 female egg samples
  * How many larvae samples (3 days exposure)?
  * How many zygote samples (8 hour zygotes)?

* Review with Elise the larvae phenotype data and identify pools to determine which pools might be particularly interesting.

* Write up tentative sequencing costs sheet based on Novaseq s1 and Illumina 4500 using parameters we discussed 
  * WGBS vs MBD
  * 40x coverage
  * 10% duplication
  * 685 mb genome size vs MBD size (get from Roberts group?)
  * 200 bp length (find citation discussing optimal read length and send to Katie) - Zymo kit recommends 50 bp length - so for Illumina calculator will use 100 bp for paired-end reads https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/pico-methyl-seq-library-prep-kit

* Look up different enrichment kits and reach out to see if we can get samples
  * MBD kits vs MeDip Kits
  * [List of methods](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WwWe-j4m44hrLCsZfnguvY13ncIgInQrhwBsKOz2nvU/edit#gid=0) 

* Update and check cost calculation sheet to confirm estimates
  * Thing to verify in cost calculator:
    * Amount of reads per lane
    * Account for different sequencers
    * Inclusion of enrichment techniques
    * Explote options for using MBD approach (currently only WGBS or MECsSEQ (based on exome capture)

* Extraction method used by Jon Puritz for use on filters 
 
**Testing Samples**
* Testing our ability to extract DNA from filtered samples using Block 3 individuals.
