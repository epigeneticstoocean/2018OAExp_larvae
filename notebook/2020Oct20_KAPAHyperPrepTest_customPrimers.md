# Library prep test using KAPA hyper prep kit and custom primers

## Overview
This test was to confirm that the custom design primers (specifically the stock I am working with) is work properly. For the test I made new working stocks for both the adapters (y-inline nobarcode) and the primers (). I then performed a standard KAPA hyperplus library prep on three samples (Sample 1: using the KAPA standard primers for the final PCR step, Sample 2: using the long custom i5 primer, Sample 3: using the short custom i5 primer). The aim was to confirm these working stocks should work using a protocol that has worked previous with these primers.

## Thoughts

I appears that the PCR was unsuccessfull using the KAPA Hyper prep kit following standard manufacturers instructions. From the tapestation we still see the final product in S2 and S3 (the original custom i5 and the new short custom i5,respectively) were the same as the target size of the sheared DNA (150bp). There is also a spike at small bp (~70-80bp) which indicates that some dimer might be present. Not sure what happened here, possible the overnight A-tailing, which is not ideal but according to the directions should not inhibit any ligation or amplification from occuring. Next I will confirm that the initial sample, primer, and adapters look like good quality and in the appropriate concentration.
