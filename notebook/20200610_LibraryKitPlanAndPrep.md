## Libary Plan and Preparation

Zymo Response: Based on [the sample summary](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/notebook/20200617_SummaryOfExtractions.md) I reached to Zymo to determine if we should implement and size selection or purification prior to bisulfite treatment. Here are there recommendations:

Unless you are trying to aim for a certain library fragment size going into sequencing, I recommend just using the DNA that you have without a size selection. For low amounts of DNA, you should still use the bisulfite conversion step to fragment. The bisulfite conversion reaction can accommodate low inputs of DNA and only has an upper limit (up to 2 ug per reaction) for efficient conversion.
