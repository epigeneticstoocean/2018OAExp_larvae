# Revised plan for sample sequencing

**Description** : To look at intergenerational DNA methylation I will be using a **WGBSseq** approach to sequence female (eggs) and larvae (pooled samples on filters) to look at the potential for transmission of epigenetic marks, with a specific focus on identifying marks that are differentially methylated among OA treatments.

**Samples**
* Eggs from females exposed for 1 month (2 treatments x 8 females per treatment)
* Zygotes (fertilized eggs reared in control conditions for a couple of hours)
* Larvae  (3 day old D stage larvae)

**Sequencing Pipeline**
* Extraction using omega kit (using our current kit to try out the extraction protocol)
    * Alternative: [Kit Jon used for his larvae stuff](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)
    * **Note** : library prep. does not need sonicated DNA (bisulfite conversion is responsible for the shearing).
* Library Prep - [Pico kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/pico-methyl-seq-library-prep-kit)
    * [Protocol](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d5455_d5456_picomethylseq.pdf)
    * We have 50 preps.
* Pool and Sequence

**Barcoding Breakdown**

**Sequence Estimates**

**Sequencer Targets**
* Machine :  Illumina 4500
* Coverage : 40x
* Expected duplication % : 10% (based on previous data)
* Bp length : Zymo recommends 50bp (100 bp paired).
