# Library Prep of L18 larvae / blastula samples - November 17th 2020

## Summary
Performed pico methylation library prep on first two offspring samples with the new primers. In the prep I also included a control (100ng of lambda DNA). Final elution was in the pico methylation elution buffer (elution volume 12 uL). I quantified using the Qubit and with the tapestation (each requiring 1 uL of samples). **Final volume of samples 10uL stored at -20**.

**Other notes**  
Following Putnam protocol I will be including 5% lambda DNA in the library prep to evaluate conversion efficiency (5ng of lambda DNA for 100ng of sample).
