# Example of working library prep.


## Overview
Used the pico methylation kit along with custom i5 and i7 primers to successfully perform a bs conversion and library prep. I followed manufacturers instructions EXCEPT:
1) During the initial amplification I increased the number of cycles to 9
2) I increased the index primer mixe to 2uL (1 uL of each primer at conc. of 10uM)
3) increased the libary Amp mix to 14uL to compensate for the increased primers.

### Sample Details
Zymo control sample - (used the same alteration as above by used the index primer mix A in the final step)
Custom sample rep 1 and rep 2 - Used custom i5 and i7 primers.
