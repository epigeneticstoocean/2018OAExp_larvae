## Extraction Test

I performed a preliminary test using the protocol provided by Matt Hare ([link to protocol](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/protocols/hare_larvaeExtractionProtocol.md)) using zygotes collected from control samples during block 3 (`CF03 x CM03`). 

**PAGE 3 and 4 of lab manual**

## Major Steps

* I first submerged the zygote filter in 95% EtoH contained in a 250mL beaker to check if I could see any zygotes under a microscope. I was able to observed several clumps of zygotes, but it was difficult to count how many.
* I used the 95% EtOH squeeze bottle to try and push the zygotes towards the center of the filter and then cut the filter paper out of the filter using a sterile scapel.
* The filter paper was put (whole) into a 1.5ml tube along with 500 uL lysing buffer + protK. 
    * NOTE: this is the max that could fit into the tube, but did not completely cover the filter.
* Used thermomixer set to 40C at 1000rpm to lysis zygotes overnight.
* Followed the protocol mentioned above based on a starting lysing buffer volume of 500uL. Additional details on page 3 and 4 of L18 lab notebook.
* Centrifuged at -11C at 14Krpm
* first : 14 min
* second and third : 5 min
* Resuspended DNA pellet in 50uL of TRIS HCl pH 8.0

## Results

1) Noticed that there was a large amount of precipitate (not expected given the low quantity of initial DNA material). This was still present even after resuspension in the Trise HCL solution, making me think it is from other products from the lysing step. 
      * Option 1: Could this be due to the high lysis buffer/prot. to DNA sample ratio? I ended up using quite a bit more lysing buffer to try and cover most of the filter plate.
      * Option 2: Could be a reagent issue. I will need to double check stocks and maybe prep a proven tissue sample using this method as a positive control.
      
 2) Quantification
   * Ran sample on Qubit HS DNA
      * Final Conc. 4.29 ng/ul
