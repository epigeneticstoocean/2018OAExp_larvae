## Extraction Test

I performed a preliminary test using the protocol provided by Matt Hare ([link to protocol](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/protocols/hare_larvaeExtractionProtocol.md)) using zygotes collected from control samples during block 3 (`CF03 x CM03`). 

## Major Steps
* I first submerged the zygote filter in 95% EtoH contained in a 250mL beaker to check if I could see any zygotes under a microscope. I was able to observed several clumps of zygotes, but it was difficult to count how many.
* I used the 95% EtOH squeeze bottle to try and push the zygotes towards the center of the filter and then cut the filter paper out of the filter using a sterile scapel.
* The filter paper was put (whole) into a 1.5ml tube along with 500 uL lysing buffer + protK. 
    * NOTE: this is the max that could fit into the tube, but did not completely cover the filter.
* Used thermomixer set to 40C at 1000rpm to lysis zygotes overnight.
* Followed the protocol mentioned above based on a starting lysing buffer volume of 500uL. Additional details on page 3 and 4 of L18 lab notebook.
